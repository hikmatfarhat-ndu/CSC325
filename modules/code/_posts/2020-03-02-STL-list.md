The iterator interface is common to all STL containers, including lists. 
In the example below we see that a list is a "linear" data structure that behaves
similarly to a vector, in a sense that supports **almost** the same operations.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <list>
int main(){
std::list<int> mylist{ 1,2,3,4,5 };
mylist.push_back(6);

std::list<int>::iterator itr = mylist.begin();

for (itr = mylist.begin(); itr != mylist.end(); ++itr)
    std::cout << *itr << ",";
std::cout << std::endl;
}
```
The first difference between a vector and a list is the ability to add to the **front**
of a list.
```cpp
int main() {

    std::list<int> mylist{ 1,2,3,4,5 };

    mylist.push_front(6);
    for (auto x:mylist)
        std::cout << x<< ",";
    std::cout << std::endl;
}
```

One can argue that we can do the same by using the vector::insert at the beginning. Let us
compare the performance of the two.
```cpp
using namespace std::chrono;
int main() {
std::random_device e;
std::uniform_int_distribution<> dist(1, 10);

std::vector<int> myvec;

auto startv = system_clock::now();
for(int i=0;i<1000000;i++)
   myvec.insert(myvec.begin(), dist(e));

auto elapsed = duration_cast<seconds>(system_clock::now() - startv);
std::cout << elapsed.count() << std::endl;

std::list<int> mylist;
auto startl = system_clock::now();
for (int i = 0; i < 100000; i++)
    mylist.push_front(dist(e));
elapsed = duration_cast<seconds>(system_clock::now() - startl);
std::cout << elapsed.count() << std::endl;

}
```
On my computer the operations on a vector takes more than a minute whereas on a list less than
a second. As explained in class this is because every time we insert at the beginning of the 
vector we need to **move** all existing elements to the right which is an O(n) operation 
instead of constant for a list.

On the other hand, random access is very costly in the case of a list. Notice that std::list
does not have an indexing operator like in the case of a vector. We can simulate that 
using the STL function std::advance

```cpp
using namespace std::chrono;
int main(){
std::random_device e;
std::uniform_int_distribution<> dist(1, 10);

const int n=1000000;
const int ops=1000;
std::vector<int> myvec(n);
std::list<int> mylist(n);

std::generate(myvec.begin(), myvec.end(), [&]() { return dist(e); });
std::generate(mylist.begin(), mylist.end(), [&]() { return dist(e); });

auto startv = system_clock::now();
for (int i = 0; i < ops; i++)
    std::advance(myvec.begin(), n/2);
auto elapsed = duration_cast<seconds>(system_clock::now() - startv);
std::cout << elapsed.count() << std::endl;
auto startl = system_clock::now();
for (int i = 0; i < ops; i++)
    std::advance(mylist.begin(), n/2);
elapsed = duration_cast<seconds>(system_clock::now() - startl);
std::cout << elapsed.count()<<std::endl;
}    
```
On my computer the operations for the list take about a minute whereas for a vector less than
a second. Again, as explained in class random access for a list is an O(n) operation.

These are the main differences between a vector and a list. Other than that they can be
treated in the same using STL algorithms.

For example, filtering both a vector and a list should in principle take the roughly the same amount of time  since both are scanned in a linear fashion. We have seen the example below when discussing std::vector. The example below explores that idea. As you can see the vector performance
is much better. This is due to difference in allocation strategies between vector and list.
When a vector is **full** its capacity is increased exponentially whereas in the case of a list
only a single node is added every time.

```cpp
 using namespace std::chrono;

        const int n = 1000000;
        std::random_device e;
        std::uniform_int_distribution<> dist(1, 10);
        std::vector<int> v;
        std::list<int> l;
        v.resize(n);
        l.resize(n)
        std::generate(v.begin(), v.end(), [&]() {return  dist(e); });
        std::vector<int> ov;
        std::list<int> ol;
        auto startv = system_clock::now();
        std::copy_if(v.begin(), v.end(), std::back_insert_iterator(ov),
            [](int i) { return i % 2 ==0; });

        auto elapsed = duration_cast<seconds>(system_clock::now() - startv);    
        auto startl = system_clock::now();

        std::copy_if(l.begin(), l.end(), std::back_insert_iterator(ol),
            [](int i) { return i % 2 ==0; });
        elapsed = duration_cast<seconds>(system_clock::now() - startl);    

    }

```

Even when  the operations on both lists an vectors is asymptotically the same it is almost 
always better to use a vector unless we need to insert/delete at the beginning (or arbitrary position) of the data.
