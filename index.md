## Description
This is the standard algorithm course where the student is introduced to the different algorithm
design paradigms: divide-and-conquer, greedy and dynamic programming. Network flows and 
applications are covered as well. In addition NP compleness is introduced from the theoretical, 
e.g. reductions, and practical perspective. Different methods for dealing with NP complete 
problems such as backtracking, branch and bound and using SAT solvers are covered.
